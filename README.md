# DB Objectify
Tool that converts database tables into objects and creates models and controllers to work with data. Based on CodeIgniter and my_model

Purpose of system is to generate php classes for database tables specified with models and controllers. 
CodeIgniters configured database is used as source to work from
Uses MY_Model (https://github.com/lonnieezell/my_model) in Models generated.

Models and Controllers are generated for the objects as required.

Linked Models (one master table, multiple children) can also be generated based on config file.

Sample Controller with display and manipulate functions can also be generated if required.

Base classes are generated for each Object and Controller to help speed up development of DB driven systems.

# Dedication
This system is done in dedication to my children. 
To my son I pray and believe that one day you will get well and after all these years 
of suffering you will be able to go and chase your dreams that has been taken from you
with this illness. To my daugther I know you have lived in the shadow of your brothers
illness all this time and want to thank you even when times are hard sometimes you always 
are there for him and love him fully. You will become a wonderfull woman I believe one day.
Love you with my whole heart.
